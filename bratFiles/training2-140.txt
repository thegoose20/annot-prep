His publication Memoir of Sir Andrew Crombie Ramsay, ( 1895) was well received and it is likely that these letters were collected during the preparation for this work. Sir Andrew Crombie Ramsay(1814-1891)had a distinguished geological career. He preferred to concentrate on stratigraphy, rather than the more fashionable palaeontology. After employment with the Geological Survey of Great Britain, Sir Ramsay became professor of geology at University College, London in 1847.
